# Archival stability - updated analysis

This repository contains the data and script to create **Figure 6.1** of my dissertation, which is part of the _Longevity and reproducibility of bioinformatics software_ chapter.

The plot is an updated version of the one from the paper of [Mangul et al. (2019)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000333).

The ready-to-use data has been provided in the `data/` folder. You can read how the data was generated at [github.com/csangara/good.software/download.parse.data](https://github.com/csangara/good.software/tree/master/download.parse.data). This is a fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/smangul1/good.software) with updated instructions, as well as additional scripts to make your life easier, e.g., the programmatic downloading of the articles.
